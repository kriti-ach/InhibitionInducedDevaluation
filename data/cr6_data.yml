columns:
  - response: 
    Description: The subject's response to the stimulus.

    Type: int
    Example: "0"
  - reaction_time:
    Description: The time it took the subject to respond to the stimulus, in milliseconds.
    (0 = no response)
    Type: float
    Example: "0.0"
  - block:
    Description: The current block in a given phase of the experiment. Phase 2 has 17 blocks, Phase 3 has 5 blocks.
    Type: int
    Example: "1"
  - which_phase:
    Description: The phase of the experiment.
    Type: String
    Example: ""phase_2""
  - stop_signal_trial_type:
    Description: For phase 2 only, whether the trial is a go or stop trial.
    Type: String
    Example: ""go""
  - stop_signal_stimulus:
    Description: The color of the stop signal.
    Type: String
